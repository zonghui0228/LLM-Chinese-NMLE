## Data
We collected questions from Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE), the Chinese National Pharmacist Licensing Examination (NPLE), and the Chinese National Nurse Licensing Examination (NNLE) from year 2017 to 2021. In NMLE, each exam consists of 4 units, each unit has 150 questions, for a total of 600 questions. In NPLE, each exam consists of 4 units, each unit has 120 questions, for a total of 480 questions. In NNLE, each exam consists of 2 units, each unit has 120 questions, for a total of 240 questions. Based on the requirements of the examination, a correct response rate exceeding the accuracy threshold of 0.6 is considered to meet the passing criteria.
